* repo structure refactoring
 * the django project (thresh) should be an example project (or submodule) instead of the root directory of the django application (main)
 * requirements.txt should be in the directory above the django application
 * mv this TODO to the directory above the django application
 * create setup.py for the application

* django-registration-templates: fork it and create setup.py so it can be just installed with the requirements instead of having a git submodule

* django-registration: using https://bitbucket.org/mszamot/django-registration/commits/df2a8e1c46a2, instead of pypi django-registration from https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration, until pull request 58 (https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/pull-request/58/compatibility-with-custom-user-mode-in/diff) is accepted, to have compatibility with custom user models

* bugs
 * index.html shows "log in" instead of "logged in" after being logged in
